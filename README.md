## About Game

The objective of Switch Up! is simple. Just collect objects that spawn randomly around the map, and throw them into the goal to score points. The more points you score, the better.

You only have 90 seconds, but as the theme suggests there will be a mix up - every 10 seconds there will be a new challenge you have to live by. 

If you fall off the map or do something that the challenge told you not to do, you'll die, and your score will reset.  But don't worry, you can still show your high score off to all of your friends.
